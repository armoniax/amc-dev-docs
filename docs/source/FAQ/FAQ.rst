What kind of technology platform is Armonia?
============================================

Armonia is composed of the mother chain (Armonia Meta Chain) and other
isomorphic or heterogeneous child chains (Armonia Child Chain).
Efficient bidirectional cross-chain of assets is realized between mother
chain and child chains as well as among the child chains, forming a
mother-child multi-chain technology platform.

Armonia is a multi-chain platform. How is the mother chain designed?
====================================================================

Armonia Meta Chain adopts APoS consensus mechanism and WASM virtual
machine and is designed with low transaction model and unique account
model.

How are the child chains of Armonia designed?
=============================================

Armonia's child chains are quickly constructed from the provided L0 SDK,
which can be isomorphic or heterogeneous with the mother chain. Other
independent public chains such as Bitcoin can also be integrated into
child chains, forming a multi-chain architecture altogether.

Regarding the multi-chain hierarchical structure used by Armonia, how to realize interconnection between chains?
================================================================================================================

Armonia provides L0-base as a general transaction routing module, which
can quickly identify and process running nodes of a single chain.

In Armonia's multi-chain ecosystem, what are the possible application scenarios that can be built through the mother chain?
===========================================================================================================================

Assets in various ecosystems can be issued, transferred, traded, and
exchanged quickly. Incentive mining pools for ecosystem development
will be built. Mother chain accounts support kyc/kyb and upper-layer 
applications with regulatory requirements.

In the Armonia multi-chain ecosystem, what are the possible application scenarios that can be constructed through child chains?
===============================================================================================================================

Realize a high-performance, low-latency decentralized exchange; 
implement a quiz-type application platform; provide various chain games, NFTs and Metaverse, etc.

What are the total design amount and management mechanism of the mother chain at present?
========================================================================================

The mother chain is currently designed with a total of 1,000,000,000 tokens governed by DAO and adopts an ecosystem destruction mechanism.

What is the framework of APOS (Armonia DPOS) as the mother chain consensus mechanism?
=====================================================================================

The framework divides nodes into main nodes and backup nodes which mine main blocks
and backup blocks respectively; one main and one backup interweave with each other to increase yields.

Why can the double-chain structure of one main and one backup increase revenue?
===============================================================================

One master and one backup chains can support 10,021 nodes to participate in mining, 
and each additional backup chain can add 10,000 backup chain mining nodes.
