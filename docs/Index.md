**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

**Armonia** is a mother-child multichain blockchain platform, wherein there's **Armonia Meta Chain (AMC)** which is the mother chain to all other sovereign Armonia Child Chains (ACC). Armonia Meta Chain is designed to be highly secure, highly performant with very low and even zero transaction fees. It also supports inter-blockchain bridging and mirroring of assets in order to support numerous DAPPs to be built on top of the platform. Under a multichain architecture, Armonia is poised to support at least one billion users worldwide.
